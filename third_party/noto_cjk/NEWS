Noto Sans CJK 1.001 Release Notes
=================================

With this release there have been a number of bug fixes and some
reorganization of the packages.  The package reorganization carries with it
a small name change that affects the name of the file, menu name, and the
internal PostScript name of the original OTF format font.  This is a one
time name change only and names will be stable going forward.

Bug Fixes
---------
There have been a number of fixes but the two most obvious ones are the fix
in the alignment of the traditional Chinese punctuation and adjustment of
the designs used for traditional Chinese to align better for usage in Hong
Kong.

Package Reorganization
----------------------
With this release there was an expansion in the number of file formats and
combinations in which the fonts are being made available.

There are now four major groups of font files by package in this release.
These are:

* Super OpenType Collection (Super OTC)
    - This is a new format this release that bundles all 7 weights for all 4
      languages into one large font resource.  It is smaller overall than
      the combination of the 28 fonts that would be used otherwise because
      of resource sharing and it is much easier to install.

* OpenType Collection (OTC)
    - Each OTC fully supports each of the four languages. There are 7 of these
      with one for each weight.

* Language Specific OTF
    - Each font file supports each of the four languages by using the OpenType
      ‘locl’ feature. However, by default, when the ‘locl’ feature is not
      used, each font file supports a specific language.  That means that
      there are 28 font files - 4 languages x 7 weights.
    - This format of 4 language specific variants is new with this release and
      replaces the previous single language variant that required the use of
      the ‘locl’ feature.  This is where the name change occurred as we now
      tag the various versions with the name of the default language.

* Region Specific OTF subsets
    - Each font file supports a region specific subset of the full fonts.
      These contain only the glyphs needed for the specific region.  There
      are 28 of these font files - 4 languages x 7 weights.
