Noto Sans CJK 1.002 Release Notes
=================================

This release includes a license change, the addition of several new font instances, and a
number of bug fixes.

----------------------
License Change
----------------------
The open source license is changed from Apache License, Version 2.0 to SIL Open Font
License, Version 1.1.

---------------------------
New Font Instances
---------------------------
In total eight (4 languages x 2 weights) monospaced half-width OTF fonts were added, in
regular and bold weights.

 - Noto Sans Mono CJK SC Regular and Bold
 - Noto Sans Mono CJK JP Regular and Bold
 - Noto Sans Mono CJK KR Regular and Bold
 - Noto Sans Mono CJK TC Regular and Bold

The monospace fonts differ from the existing ones only in that the default (encoded)
glyphs for ASCII (U+0020 to U+007E), U+00A0 ( ), U+00A5 (¥), U+2011 (‑), and U+20A9 (₩)
are half-width instead of proportional.

The new monospace fonts can be found in:
 - All-in-one CJK super OTC font (now includes 36 font instances)
 - CJK OTF fonts with different default language (two additional font instances for each
   language)
 - NotoSansCJK-Regular.ttc and NotoSansCJK-Bold.ttc (four additional font instances in
   each)

Although eight new font instances were added, the footprint of the super OTC only
increased by 1M or so, mainly due to the four additional ‘cmap’ tables. Two of the seven
OTC now contain eight font instances.
